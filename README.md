## Statement

Hi and welcome to team Pizzeria. As you know, we are a small inn and our principal activity is
product Pizza, to organize our activity we have a program that works properly and in a vision
of future expansion (database, HTML...), we need to adapt the program to better meet our
requirements, but be careful it is imperative that the program remains functional.
